				At Anything But Read, we know reading isn’t always our favorite thing to do, but we also recognize how important and rewarding it can be. That’s why we’ve made it easier by offering two great book recommendations every month—one for kids and one for adults. These are short reads that pack a punch, making them worth your time even if reading isn't your usual go-to activity. This month’s picks are below:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>KIDS: House of the Scorpion</li><!-- Small un ordered list. Thought about a table but a list seemed like a better fit -->
				<li>ADULTS: The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F**k</li><!--These are both real books that ive read; amazing reads-->
			</ul>
