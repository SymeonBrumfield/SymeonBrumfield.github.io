					At Anything But Read, we believe libraries are so much more than just books! Libraries today are public spaces filled with exciting activities and endless possibilities for both kids and adults. For example, did you know that many libraries offer free computer and internet access? Whether you want to browse the web, work on a school project, or learn something new, libraries provide the technology and tools you need. They even have fun tech workshops where you can learn how to code or design your own video games! Below we've provided a list of services libraries provide.

				<ul><!-- un ordered list because i didnt need these items numbered-->
					<li>Craft Workshops</li>
					<li>Movie Night </li>
					<li>Yoga Classes</li>
					<li>Resume Workshops</li>
					<li>Game Nighs</li>
					<li>And More!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Libraries truly are sanctuaries in every sense of the word. At Anything But Read, we highlight how libraries offer a peaceful and welcoming space where anyone can find a sense of calm and safety. Whether youâ€™re a child looking for a cozy corner to read, a student needing a quiet place to study, or an adult seeking some personal time away from the hustle and bustle, libraries provide the perfect environment to unwind and focus.
